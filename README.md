# WhatsHelper
## A utility app for sending WhatsApp messages

#### A flutter application which sends whatsapp messages directly to the contact number without saving contact in the contact directory.

“Hey, 909*****40 is my number please ping on on WhatsApp so that I could send you your bill.”/n

*// in mind// “Saving a number and then sending a message just for a bill, uh lots of work.”/n

*“Look on your face shows that you don’t know about a new app where you could send WhatsApp to people who aren’t in your contact list.”

*“OMG, please tell me about it!”/n

Saving numbers of people with whom you down have connection could be a leak to your privacy, as those people could also see the stories you shared for the people you know. So here is an application that will help you to WhatsApp anyone, without saving their number on your phone, here you could just enter the number you want to send a message on WhatsApp, and our application with directly take you to WhatsApp and open the chat of the person whose number you entered./n

Our application is totally safe to use as we don’t save any of the information you enter or the numbers that you provide./n

We will be building a single-paged flutter application, it will ask for a phone number that is registered on WhatsApp and below that would be a button that will lead directly to WhatsApp where you could send the message to the person who isn’t in your contact list. It will look as follow:

## Usage of this app:

⚫ There is no option in the Whatsapp app to directly message a number.<br>
⚫ So while sending the message, we first have to save that number and then only we are able to message the desired number.<br>
⚫ But sometimes we have to message a person only once or we don't want to save that number because it increases the number of contacts saved, in that case our app is    the ultimate solution of this problem.<br>
⚫ In this way we can directly send a message to a number on Whatsapp without saving their contact details.<br>
